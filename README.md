# Pi-Bench

A small benchmarking framework for the Raspberry Pi to collect accurate function timings.
- Uses macros for low overhead timing
- pinning to CPUs and setting priorities for single threaded applications
- either using cycles or time
- track CPU temperature to avoid throtteling
- set baselines calculate relative performance

## Future Features

- save to csv
- result validation
